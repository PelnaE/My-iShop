# reGative`s iShop (based on Kohana 3.2)

## What is it?

This is my first attemp to create solid iShop.
Please, help me and find out bugs!

## Is It used for actual i-shop?

No, and I don't use it, because I need time to find out all bugs. I don't recomment to use it for you as well. At least, at the moment.

## ...and author?

Author is reGative - young Web Developer, who is learning PHP5 and PHP MVC Frameworks (at this moment, Kohana).
